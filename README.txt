<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b>
================

1. Do I need to sign up to PushAssist to use this plugin?

Yes, you can create your FREE account from the plugin itself. If you are already using PushAssist just copy your API Key & Secret Key from PushAssist control panel and paste in Drupal dashboard once.

Your theme needs to have the header and footer actions in place before the &lt;/head&gt; and before the &lt;/body&gt;

3. Can PushAssist be implemented on HTTP Websites?

Yes, PushAssist can be implemented on a HTTP or HTTPS websites. In case you want to use your own GCM keys we welcome you to add those in your PushAssist control panel. To add your own GCM API keys please follow the instructions by Google on how to create a GCM key <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/push-notifications/step-04?hl=en">here</a> . Please note that in step 3 you should select Server Key.

Since Push Notifications requires the website be on SSL aka HTTPS we create a sub domain for you which is a valid HTTPS sub domain like <b>https://yoursite.pushassist.com</b>. We can also help you setup PushAssist if you have your own Https domain and want to send notifications from your domain name.

4. What will happen when i reach 3000 subscribers in my FREE account?

Once you reach 3000 subscribers, PushAssist will continue to work and let you collect more subscribers but will not let you send notifications to these new subscribers. You can send unlimited notifications to your first 3000 subscriber but to send notifications to all subscribers you need to upgrade to premium (Paid) account.

5. What will push notifications look like?

That depends on the browser! Each browser will display your notifications somewhat differently, but in general the notifications will look appropriate for the device/OS/browser on which they are displayed
